                	The point of this site is to show off the owner's past designs, to entice clients to hire him. At first glance, it doesn't do such a good job at this, since the gallery images are quite small. The texts are small and a bit hard to read as well. However, the secondary pages that pops up upon clicking a gallery image is simple and does show of his skills in design.

                	Navigation buttons on top are a little small and since the color is the same as the entire site, it's not very obvious that they're there. There are "next page" buttons under the gallery, but it blends into the design a little too well, that a normal user wouldn't think it's a button at all (which is not a good thing). The simple click-and-pop opening of the gallery pieces are good though.

The site also gives a lively feeling since it uses a lot of circles and most of the elements on the site twitches once in a while. The use of round corners and fonts shows the designer's light personality as opposed to seriousness.

                	This site has a <b>horrible</b> functionality. When the user first opens the site, he/she will have no idea what the site is trying to express, since it's just a blank. Apparently the user has to draw on the blank spaces to see more content, but after that, users will have to play around with the site for another long while to figure out what to do with the content (since at first the contents come in pieces..). Then there's too much text to read through for each piece of the designs they're trying to show off, and my guess is by this time most users won't have the patience to read through.

On the other hand, some links on the page are in black text, and have no indication that they're clickable. Also, there are three major secondary pages, but all three of them have completely different layouts as the home page and from each other; this forces the users to relearn the site everytime they navigate.

This engages the user to "see more examples", but at the same time it's easy to lose track of where one is on thte page. Would be nice if there's a "back to top" feature.

There are no thumb nails or icons of any of her past works (they're only listed in text). Considering that it's a very long list, it's a bit hard to expect the users to find a piece that attracts them, or have the patience to browse through all of them one by one. There are no caption or commentary as to what the past works are about, which leaves users uninformed.

The gallery was nice in that it's divided into different type of projects, and also for each project there are some close-up shots of detailed design work. Since she has enough close-up shots of the images from different angles, textual description of the project can be neglected rightfully. It is interesting to display quotes from her past clients.

                	There are not too much descriptions or hints on what this site is trying to tell you. One to two words captions are given to each piece, which is not at all informative. All pieces are layed out in a waterfall straight line down the page, which is quite hard to follow, especially since there's no spacing in between each of them.

                	There's seemingly a lot of interaction going on. Many things are blacking in and out, and upon hovering an image, some caption takes over the image. However, it is not very obvious to the viewers at first that these effects are trying to help you focus on a certain piece. It takes a while to get the hang of how this site is trying to interact with you.

                	Horrible navigation. On the very top, there's a compilation of gallery thumb nails that's supposed to lead you to the right part of the whole page; However, it is not very obvious to the viewers that these images are meant to be clicked on, since so much is already happening upon hover. Clickable and unclickable images have no differences when unhovered, so you actually have to hover through the entire site to see what's clickable and what's not. Back to top button is present, but very tiny.

                	From the first second of looking at the page, it already communicated very well that the focus of the site are the photos; since everything other than the photo are black/white and static. Description of each project are present, but is positioned in a very awkward place that the users might miss. Bio page and contact page are quite long and hard to read through.

                	The gallery has suitable level of interactivity. auto-scroll that follows the mouse movement is quite engaging and easy to use. Toolkit on the icons that pops up upon hover is a good addtion, since it doesn't block the viewing of photo but provides hint when needed. I noticed that left and right arrows can also be used to browse, which is quite thoughtful.
